//Closer is related to funtions 
// nested functions means functions inside funtions
// there has to be dependency
//A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.

// function greet(){
//     let n = "Raj";
//     return function(){
//        return function(){

//                console.log(n);

//        }
//     }
// }


// let x = greet();
// let y = x();
// y();


//Debouncing
